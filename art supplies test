/*
Art Supplies is one of the businesses identified as a priority for CRM, based on YOY sales growth and because of the destination nature of the category. Rich and Jen have met last week to discuss the need of getting more in-depth information about the art customers, to learn more about who they are and their shopping behavior.

Recently, we’ve implemented a test in the East Hanover store #9860 which Chuck R. has seen and has asked to get consumer results. We would like to get the consumer data, for the chain and also for the test store, to see if there are any learnings that can be applied chain-wide.

70 PAINTING ART SUPPLIE


Here is what we’re thinking:
- Use sales data for this year weeks 22 – 31 (after test implementation)
- Sales for department 70 Painting Art Supplies
#NAME?
- Store #9860 info
#NAME?
o % to total sales
o Variance to LY to see if they increased or declined
o Frequency of visits
o Basket size per visit
o UPTs and AUR
#NAME?
o % to total sales
o Variance to LY to see if they increased or declined
o Frequency of visits
